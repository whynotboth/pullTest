<p class=MsoNormal>The Big Sick Review</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big Sick was such a well-rounded, solid movie that in
the final analysis, there’s really no one thing to hold onto. The forever hokey
expression “team effort” is somehow the most honest thing that can be said
about this film. The writing was great, the acting was great, the directing was
great, the story was great. They didn’t reinvent the wheel with this one, they
simply did a great job at every level of production and found a way to make a
fresh and true version of a romance film.  They did for this genre what Shane
Black did for the action genre with lethal weapon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was such a fundamentally good movie, that in this
romantic comedy - a love story between two people - they literally put the
female lead in a coma and let her sit out half the movie, and it was still the
best rom-com I’ve seen that didn’t star Tom Hanks or John Cusack. Watching this
movie was like watching a sports team that was so dominant on both sides of the
ball that they had to take their starters out of the game and play with the B
squad for fear of looking like showboats; only to discover that their B squad
was full to the gills with future hall-of-famers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like all Apatow produced movies, this one could have been
stronger if they trimmed off a good 30 minutes, but that being said, I didn’t
mind it. I liked spending the extra time in their world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thing they got really right, wasn’t that they managed to
tackle such big divisive issues, but that they did it was such honest humor and
taste. They used the precision and nuance of a veteran chiropractor, attending
to and relocating areas that we didn’t know needed attention, and before we
could protest, we’re on our way out the door, with a lollypop in our mouth and
a spring in our step. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Not everyone will love it as much as I did, but nobody is
walking out pissed that they saw this one. </p>
