</span></span>Cinematographer: Roger Deakins (the man deserves his own bullet
point for his work here.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are those who will say this movie is a masterpiece,
and there are those who will say it’s a complete shit bomb. Both pretty much
have a valid point. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four years ago I saw a movie called “Prisoners” and upon
leaving, was absolutely certain that whoever this unknown was that directed it,
was someone to keep an eye on. His last few movies have made me nothing short
of smug about my initial assessment of the man’s work, and after seeing the way
he helmed this years blade runner sequel, the jury’s in. Denis Villeneuve is
this generations first real player that can work at the level of the old guard
of filmmakers. If he keeps up this level of craftsmanship, it’s not a question
of ‘will he win an Oscar?’ it’s a question of ‘how many times over?’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Together with cinematographer Roger Deakins, who I strongly
believe - despite whatever else comes out this year - WILL win the Oscar,
Villeneuve managed to create one of the most visually stunning pictures I’ve
ever been fortunate enough to see. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the very same time, the story was so full of itself and
underwhelming that as time went on, you almost stopped giving a shit how
beautiful it looked. Like being in a long-term relationship with Katherine
Heigl (heyy-oooh!); and clocking in at a lethargic 164 minutes long, you have
plenty of time to get bored here. There were a lot of really cool throwbacks to
the original film, but after a while, instead of elevating this movie, it sort
of started to make me second guess how much I liked the first one.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ryan Gosling did a great job, although looking stoically ahead
with dried blood splatter on his face isn’t exactly a range tester for him. The
rest of the supporting cast did a great job as well, I think, But the second
the one who was playing his hologram girlfriend, and the one who was playing
the cyborg “replicant” hooker overlapped to have a three-way with Gosling’s
character, I lost just enough objectivity to say for sure if it was great
acting, or if it was just an amalgam of the top 5 Pornhub searches personified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you can appreciate a great visual spectacle, I recommend
catching this one on as big of a screen as you possibly can, but if you’re not
willing to give it a bit of leeway, it might not be for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PERSCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For other movies based on the work of Philip K. Dick: Watch <i>Minority
Report</i>, <i>Total Recall.</i></p>
