<p class=MsoNormal>Home Again review</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Home Again is a movie about an extremely attractive woman
who let’s three extremely attractive guys come stay with her and her two
daughters in an effort to stave off the loneliness caused by her fresh
separation from her extremely attractive husband which finally answers the age
old question – what if you turned your favorite porno into a pg13 rom-com?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s the kind of movie you put on as a go-back channel when
what you’re really watching is on commercial break; it wasn’t awful, but it
wasn’t exactly good either. The movie was sort of the romantic film equivalent
of when an alien eats a human and wears its body as a suit attempting to pass
its self off as one of us. It’s hard to describe exactly what about it doesn’t
feel on the up and up, but I get the feeling it would have worked better as a
show. The characters weren’t so much driving at something as they were
passively taking in what life was giving them and waiting around to see how it
all came together. This attitude was transferred to the audience as well; the
overly abundant would-be love interests made it impossible to root for anything
or anyone. This wasn’t a love triangle, it was a love pentagon. Instead of
hoping characters would see the error of their ways and just be together
already, like they were meant to be, we all (and by we all, I mean the packed
auditorium of senior gals and myself) just kind of watched and waited, like we
were table side for a slow motion game of dice in which any possible combination
that came up would be eh, fine, and just as good as the next. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The writer/director Hallie Meyers-Shyer has a long way to go
before she climbs out of her parents humongous shadows (you can do that
research on your own – screw it, Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer! Private
Benjamin, Father of the Bride, Parent Trap, etc.) but this is also her first go
at bat, and while I wasn’t blown away by any means, I also don’t have anyone
else on my radar who has a better shot at picking up this genres torch for the
next generation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PERSCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hate to say it, but work your way through her parents
stuff. </p>
