<p class=MsoNormal>American Assassin Review </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>After his fiancée is killed by a group of Islamic terrorists on
their beach vacation, Mitch Rapp throws himself into the world of
counter-terrorism. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Starring Dylan O’Brien, Michael Keaton, Sanaa Lathan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’re the kind of guy that enjoys zoning out and
watching your friends little brother play Counter-strike, or Metal Gear,
pretending he’s a next level badass because he can manage to locate the X
button, then boy do I have a movie for you!  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can’t really explain the beats on this one, and I’ll bet
neither can the writers. It took 5 separate screenwriters to Frankenstein this
one together out of, I’m guessing, old spec scripts that Steven Seagal turned
down and Gerard Butler was too busy to do. All you really need to know here is:
A dude gets shafted by a group of generic terrorists and less than a year
later, through sheer rage, he’s this country’s best shot at taking down the
next terrorist threat. The rest of the details are pretty much just a series of
bland zigs and zags on the paint by numbers path to the obvious conclusion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I knew I was screwed the first time the term “weapons grade
plutonium” came up. And, I’ll bet, so did the guy two rows in front of me. I
can’t speak for the dude in the second row, though. that son of a bitch walked
out leaving us high and dry after his snacks ran out. I guess the sentiment “no
man left behind” doesn’t extend to the brotherhood of the audience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a movie about infiltrating and “eliminating” Muslim anti-American
groups, I must say, I was extremely relieved and grateful when I discovered the
main antagonist was an American white terrorist. I spent the first act of this
film shamelessly trying to figure out how I was going to cover my own ass while
traversing that eggshell walk of a topic. So, my compliments to writer #4(?)
for coming up with that get-out-of-jail-free card. Another high point for me
was Michael Keaton who played the stars tough as nails, ex-SEAL mentor. Though
god only knows how Keaton managed to fenagle this role away from Kevin Costner.
He damn well knows these parts are guaranteed to Mr. Costner this decade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This movie is like a pizza Lunchable. It wasn’t awful, but
only because it managed to stack the same old pre-packaged, sectioned off
ingredients together in basically the right order. Consume this one, if you
must. But don’t expect any real sustenance or nutritional value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<i>The Jackal, Shooter, Wanted, True Lies, Jason Bourne, Casino Royale, Mission
