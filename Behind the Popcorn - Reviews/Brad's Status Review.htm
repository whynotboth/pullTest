</span></span>Written by Mike White – School of rock, Orange County, Nacho
Libre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The movie, maybe not ‘tackled’, but tinkered around with,
certainly, some solid themes like how to measure personal success, and the
rivalry and jealousy that comes along with certain long term friendships. But
for all its solemn expression, the story never quite gets off the ground. The
writer/director Mike White has penned some great movies in the past, but this
one would have worked much better as a book. In fact, in watching this I almost
convinced myself that not only must this be a poorly adapted novel, but that it
was probably written by a female minority as a cheeky parody of what a white
man’s “struggle” must be. In this fantasy, I even allowed myself to get a
little worked up about the audacity of this fictitious writer. The double
standard! That is, of course, until I realized this was written, in earnest, by
a well-off Caucasian male whose last name is literally “White.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stiller (who’s a favorite of mine) makes two types of
movies: over the top comedy blockbusters, and melancholy midlife crisis indies.
And even though his melancholy midlife crisis movies are pretty much
exclusively not good, simply refusing to watch them isn’t in the cards for me. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m a simple man. I like my movies to have up’s and down’s
and obstacles to overcome and maybe even lessons learned. This movie, like a
whole slew of films made in the last decade that are just like it, seem more
like a visual recreation of an apathetic rant given on a psychiatrist’s couch,
on a particularly nonproductive session, than a story. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were plenty of places to go with this movie, but we
we’re never taken there. It felt like an 1h 41min subplot with no conclusion.
It had potential to be the best part of another film, but on its own, I found
myself eating the popcorn quicker just so I had an excuse to mosey out and get
a refill to kill a few minutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PERSCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For A better showing by Mike White: School of Rock or Orange
County (Orange County even has a Stiller Cameo).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a midlife crisis movie: Check out Sideways or American
Beauty.</p>
