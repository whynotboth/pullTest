<p class=MsoNormal>IT throwback review </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look, when this movie came out, it was a different time.
It’s simply impossible to judge a movie (or anything for that matter) with any
degree of fairness when stripped of its historical context. I was far too young
to remember how <i>It</i> was received at the time of its original airing; for
all I know it was a total game changer. I remembered enjoying it when I was a
kid, and in preparation for the remake I took the liberty of giving the
original miniseries (staring Tim Curry as the menacing Demon clown) another
viewing. Here’s how I saw it:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 1990’s version of It holds up worse than a fingerless
gunman. For all of Pennywise’s offbeat Beetlejuiceing, he ultimately comes off
more like an annoying sibling waving his finger inches from your face than a
legitimate threat. That compounded with the over the top bravado of the school
bullies left the whole enterprise feeling like an afterschool special. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the movie goes on, the protagonists, now middle aged are
left with only vague recollections of their childhood memories of It and that
chapter of their life. As they regroup in their hometown - the scene of the
crime - they slowly begin to remember old details and the movies middle act
becomes largely about marshalling each other’s courage and convincing
themselves to not flee. In this way, I guess it could be said, the movie was
affective. Emotionally I followed that trajectory alongside them. As my
memories of previous viewings steadily came back into focus and lines and
events came flooding back to me, I too required a string of pep talks to keep
from fleeing. As we rev into the climax, obligatory fat kid, Max, announces
“The whole town’s ‘It’ in a way” laying out what we’ll call the underlying
message: cowardice and apathy are the real evil. Well when it comes to the
later, as far as the movies concerned, I guess I’m a pennywise. And the cost of
an online rental short. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time the final credits role, the film’s iconic scene
of a flimsy paper boat sailing rockily, inevitably into a sewer almost seems
meta. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s been far too long since my last reading of the novel in
which this film was adapted, so I can’t speak with confidence as to whether or
not the movie did the book justice, but here’s to hoping it didn’t.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PRESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a better version: watch the remake.</p>
